# Disclaimer
I do not claim ownership for any of this art. I simply chose specific textures I liked from usernm, UU-Tex, and Kyff's hotbar resourcepacks and combined them into one FoxTex.

1. FoxTex: Personally Chosen Textures
2. Better Click: Filters out the high frequencies from clicking and reduces the volume
3. Charcoal GUI: Dark-mode GUI (also from UU-Tex)
4. Modernity: Modern Textures Backported to 1.7.10
