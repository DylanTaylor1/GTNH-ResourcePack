To install, simply download the zip files and place them in the resourcepacks folder. Other than BetterClick, I do not claim any ownership of the art. "FoxTex" is simply a personal collection of textures from usernm, UU-Tex, and Kyff's hotbar.

1. FoxTex: Personally Chosen Textures
2. Better Click: Reduces the volume and frequency of the clicking sound.
3. Charcoal GUI: Dark-mode GUI (also from UU-Tex)
4. Modernity: Modern Textures Backported to 1.7.10
