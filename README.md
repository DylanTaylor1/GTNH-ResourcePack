# Disclaimer
Other than Better Click, I do not claim any ownership for this art. I simply combined specific textures from usernm, UU-Tex, and Kyff's hotbar into one "FoxTex" resourcepack.

1. FoxTex: Personally Chosen Textures
2. Better Click: Reduces the volume and frequency of the clicking sound.
3. Charcoal GUI: Dark-mode GUI (also from UU-Tex)
4. Modernity: Modern Textures Backported to 1.7.10
